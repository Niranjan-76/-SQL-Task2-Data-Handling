Practice inserting, updating, and deleting data while handling NULLs and DEFAULT values in a structured database.

This task covers DML operations using SQL including:
- `INSERT INTO`

2. **Categories**

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Delete Unwanted Data

- Deleted customers with NULL addresses
- Deleted payment entries with NULL amount (if any)
